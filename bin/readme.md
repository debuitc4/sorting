# CA284 Systems Programming

## Introduction

This directory contains any binary files from your project.  When the `makefile` is run in the `src` directory, the compiled output (executable code) is copied here.  You may also move any datasets and/or other external files your program needs in order to run.  

Your source files should _not_ be located in this directory.
